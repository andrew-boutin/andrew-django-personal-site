# Personal Site Django

This used to be active as my personal site.

Powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - a high-level Python Web framework.
Uses [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) for HTTP server & reverse proxy.
[uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) handles feeding web client requests to Django.
Hosted on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet.

Utilizes [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to enhance HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the site.

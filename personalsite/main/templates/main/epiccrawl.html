      <strong>Technology:</strong></br>
      This game was developed in Java.  The IDE used to code in and create the executable .jar file 
      was <a class="link" href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.  
      All images for the game were created using <a class="link" href="http://pyxeledit.com/">Pyxel Edit</a>.

      <strong>Info:</strong></br>
      All of the artwork was created by a separate person for this game.  Some of the artwork was specified 
      by me, but most of it was thought up by the other person.

      The coolest feature of this game to me is the level designer that I built.  It allows me to choose 
      game objects and place them onto the map, edit the map, save levels, load levels, etc.  A nice feature 
      of the level designer is being able to create doors/portals where you can specify other levels to load 
      and locations on the map where the player goes to when they go through them.  I plan on making the 
      level designer available during game play so players can create and play their own levels.  The enemy 
      AI is another cool aspect of the game.  It uses a breadth first search algorithm to find the 
      shortest path possible to the player.

      This game was developed in C++ using 
      <a class="link" href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">CodeBlocks</a> as an IDE.  
      It's played entirely in a terminal.

      <strong>Info:</strong></br>
      This was a solo project, and it was one of the first games that I ever created.  It's 
      a fun and simple game that can be addicting when you want to get to a further level.  I developed this 
      game to re-learn the basics of C++ before I started a job as a programming intern.  I've only beaten 
      this game once after many tries so if you win email me a screenshot!

      I used an object-oriented design for this game to handle maze objects.  The most interesting part of this 
      game to me was developing an algorithm to randomly generate the mazes.  At the start of each level the 
      "maze" is completely filled with walls.  The algorithm picks a random starting location on one side of 
      the maze and begins to hollow out the walls.  It uses a depth-first approach and doesn't take out the 
      walls if there is an empty space adjacent.  When it can't go further, it retraces its steps and finds all 
      other paths to hollow out.  After, the stairs are randomly placed on the opposite side of the maze in comparison 
      to the starting point.  A few random walls are taken out afterwards to make more possible turns.

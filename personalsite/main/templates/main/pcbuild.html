<h2><span class="label label-default">PC Build</span></h2>

<div class="well outerInfo">
  I recently built my first pc!  This was a big project for me since I started off not knowing very much about computer hardware.  Lots of research
  was done before any purchases were made on how the different components work together.  I determined what I needed and wanted out of my build, created 
  a parts list, collaborated on forums, purchased the parts, and then built the pc.  The entire process took roughly 2 months from start to finish 
  and I'm extremely happy with the results.

                    "The EVO 212 cooler is massive!  I had to take off the case's side-wall fan for it to fit properly.", 
                    "The 2.5 inch SSD had to be mounted to the bottom of the case which I didn't like very much.  It didn't leave enough room for the cables in order for the drive to be properly secured.",
                    "The GTX 970 GPU was also massive!  I really like the way the card looks in the case.",
                   "Nice looking PSU and especially like how the cable mesh wrap looks.",
                    "First look after mounting all of the components.",
                    "Another angle with all of the compnents in.  Nice quick release lever for holding in the optical drive - which reads Blue-Ray, R/W DVD, and R/W CD.",
                    "Starting working on cable management and figuring out how the front components hook up to the MOBO.",
                    "After installing all of the parts I went to try it out.  Every time I would attempt to power the PC on it would shut itself off after about 1/2 second.  Started trouble-shooting to see what the problem was.  Disconnected most of the parts to eliminate possibilites and originally thought it was the MOBO shorting out on the case.",
                    "Tried using a friend's PSU and it turns out that was the issue.  Ended up having Amazon send me a new one and I sent back the defective one.",
                    "Shot of after putting in the new PSU and reconnecting all of the parts.",
                    "This time the PC stayed on and worked perfectly.",
                    "Very happy with this build - cost, looks, and performance wise.  I'll probably make another build in a couple of years."];
